just keeping my bluearp banks here. they are currently only templates for future work

This is the sort of project that will either take me many years to complete or will require crowd-sourcing the efforts of several people so I'm posting it here.

It's a bit tedious.

Currently I only have the tentative structure worked out for the bass and hihat banks.

For the bass patterns I used the terminology on a Dash Glitch video -- Off-beat, Gallop, Half-roll, and (Full-on) Rolling.  Call-and-response type patterns seem more like a type of fill that could be applied to any of the other categories.

For the hats, I went with Quarter, Eighth, Sixteenth, Dotted Eighth, and Dotted Sixteenth.

The spreadsheet is to help plan things out.
